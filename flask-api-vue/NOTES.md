# NOTES

Watch the scope creep happen!

## TO DO

 * Maybe... material design?
 * Sort out a testing strategy. https://next.vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guide/ might help.
 * Try https://esbuild.github.io/ to pack the JS. (See https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/)

## Questions

 * What's the practical difference between `:is` and the `v-runtime-template` add-on?
   * `:is` changed in 3.x. Is that significant?
