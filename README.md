# Experiments and play time

*Do Not Mistake For Production Code.*

A gathering of things I've played around with while exploring ideas,
stripped down into more-or-less working examples so that future me (or you!)
might have an easier time getting past the fiddly bits.

Completely unlicensed, unwarrantied, largely unmaintained, use-at-your-own-riskware.

The `npm` related parts accumlate security advisories from GithHub on a regular basis,
so play it safe and keep your distance from those.
