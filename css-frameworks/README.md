# Playing around with CSS Frameworks

Trying out some frameworks to see what it will take to do a few things I'd like to do.

## Notes

Bootstrap is pretty easy to work with, and has plenty of public examples.
Some folks turn their noses up at it for being old, but it works.

Tailwind has the more complete CSS reset,
meaning it provides a lower foundation that one needs to build up from.
I get the impression with Tailwind that it tilts the playing field toward folks who want you to buy their training/templates/services.

Pico CSS was recommended, but not seeing it. Looks very incomplete.

Materialize is opionated in the Material Design sense.
No surprise, but I wasn't ever a fan.
