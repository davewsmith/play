# D3.js Graph experiment

I need to draw a graph for a project, so let's play around.

The stuff here is mostly Not My Code.

## Examples from Observable

These might require a force-reload from the browser to defeat caching.

### Force-layout example

    cd force-directed-graph; python -m http.server

then open `http://localhost:8000/`

### Cola example

    cd hello-cola; python -m http.server

then open http://localhost:8000/

### https://observablehq.com/@tejasmanohar/hello-cola

This one has labels. Close to what I need.

    cd hello-cola2; python -m http/server

then open http://localhost:8000/
