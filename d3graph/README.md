# D3.js Graph experiment

I need to draw a graph for a project, so let's play around.

The stuff here is mostly Not My Code.

## Examples

Mostly from digging around on Observable

To run

    cd $dir; python3 -m http.server

then open `http://localhost:8000/

These might require a force-reload from the browser to defeat caching.

### force-directed-layout

The canonical example. Helps somewhat to have read _Les Mis√©rables._

### hello-cola

Canonical modified to use a different layout algorithm

### hello-cola2

https://observablehq.com/@tejasmanohar/hello-cola

This one has labels. Closer to what I need.
