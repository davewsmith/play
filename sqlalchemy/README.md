# Flask SQLAlchemy noodling

A bit of fluff, motivated by wanting to have something within reach to
remind myself of how to do a few things.

## Setup

Assuming `vagrant` and `virtualbox` are installed,

    vagrant up

builds an Ubuntu 20.04 VM

## Testing

    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    ./runtests
