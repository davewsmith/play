# Flask SQLAlchemy noodling

A bit of fluff, motivated by wanting to have something within reach to
remind myself of how to do a few things.

## TODO

I reached for some old 18.04-based code to get started. Update it 20.04.

## Setup

    vagrant up

## Testing

    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    ./runtests
