# Scraping PurpleAir sensors

A quick sketch of something I might use elsewhere.

## Setup

Copy `env.template` to `.env` and fill it in with PurpleAir API keys.

    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, to scape data

    ./purpleair.py SENSOR_ID > data.json

If the JSON returned from the PurpleAir API does not contain an 'error' key,
the 'sensor' block is augmented with a few new keys.

  * 'aqi' is derived per the AirNow table
  * 'category' comes from the AirNow table
  * 'category\_color' is from elsewhere in the AirNow document
