## CSS 'Holy Grail'

Three current (CSS Grid) takes at the so-called 'Holy Grail' problem of
getting a responsive header, sidebar, content area, and footer to play together.

  * [holygrail.html](holygrail.html) shows the basics
  * [loremgrail.html](loremgrail.html) pushes the footer below the bottom
  * [stickygrail.html](stickygrail.com) does the same, but with a sticky header (a one line change!)
