## CSS 'Holy Grail'

Three current (CSS Grid) takes at the so-called 'Holy Grail' problem of
getting a responsive header, sidebar, content area, and footer to play together.

  * [holygrail.html](holygrail.html) shows the basics
  * [loremgrail.html](loremgrail.html) pushes the footer below the bottom
  * [stickygrail.html](stickygrail.com) does the same, but with a sticky header (a one line change!)

Different ways to get a footer at the bottom of a page.
`vh` units fail on Phones, but there's now a `dvh` unit that
adjusts depending on whether the browser is showing the address bar.

  * [positionfooter.html](Using positioning)
  * [gridfooter.html](Using CSS Grid)
  * [flexfooter.html](Using CSS Flexbox) using `dvh`.

Misc. stuff

  * [center.html](center.html) centers using a CSS Grid

  * [app.html](app.html) is a generic app layout, made easy by CSS Grid!
